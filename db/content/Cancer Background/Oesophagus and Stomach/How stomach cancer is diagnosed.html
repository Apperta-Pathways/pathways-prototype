<font color="#444444"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Usually,
you begin by seeing your GP (family doctor). Sometimes, people are
diagnosed with stomach cancer after being admitted to hospital with a
symptom that's making them unwell.</b></font></font></font></p>

<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">At
your appointment, the GP will examine you and arrange any tests that
you need. If they think your symptoms may be serious, they’ll
arrange immediate tests or an urgent referral to a specialist doctor
at the hospital. You’ll usually see a doctor called a
gastroenterologist. They specialise in treating stomach and digestive
problems. The doctor will ask you about your symptoms and your
general health before examining you. You may also see a
gastrointestinal nurse specialist.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">You’ll
have blood tests to check your general health and to find out if
you’re anaemic. Your doctor will arrange for you to have a test
called an endoscopy to look at the inside of your stomach. This is
described below. Some people may also have a test called a barium
meal. For this, you are asked to drink a liquid called barium, which
helps to show the stomach more clearly on an x-ray.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">An&nbsp;endoscopy,
also called a gastroscopy, is the most common test used to diagnose
stomach cancer. An endoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a tiny
light and video camera at the end, which sends pictures back to a
screen. The doctor or nurse who does the test (called the
endoscopist) examines the gullet (oesophagus), the inside of your
stomach and the beginning of the small bowel.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.05in; margin-bottom: 0.12in; line-height: 100%">
<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">You
can have an endoscopy as an outpatient, so you can go home the same
day. It usually takes about 10 minutes and although it can be
uncomfortable, it’s not painful. You’ll be asked not to eat or
drink anything for at least six hours before the test. You’ll be
given instructions about any medicines you’re taking.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.05in; margin-bottom: 0.12in; line-height: 100%">
<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">To
have the endoscopy, you lie on your side on a couch. The nurse or
doctor usually gives you a sedative to relax you and make you drowsy.
This is given as an injection into a vein in your arm. Sometimes,
they spray a local anaesthetic on to the back of your throat instead.
Or they might use both the injection and the spray. The endoscopist
will then gently pass the endoscope down your gullet and into your
stomach. They may put some air down it to inflate your stomach and
make it easier to see everything. After the test is done, they will
gently remove the endoscope.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">If
you had a sedative, the effects should only last a few hours. But
you’ll need someone to drive or travel home with you. If you only
had the anaesthetic spray, you’ll need to wait until the numbness
wears off before you eat or drink.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Some
people have a sore throat after their endoscopy. This is normal and
it should get better after a few days.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#777777"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">During
the endoscopy, they can remove small samples of tissue from any areas
that look abnormal. This is called a biopsy. The tissue is examined
under a microscope to find out if there are any cancer cells.</font></font></font></p>
